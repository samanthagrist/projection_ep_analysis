**This script is designed to perform physics-based postprocessing on confocal slice images (X-Y slice, through the centre of the migrated protein band) from 3D projection electrophoresis datasets.  Contains:**

1. deconvolutionAnalysis_BSA_15s.m: script that was used to perform physics-based deconvolution postprocessing on images of separated BSA (after 15s electrophoresis in a 7%T gel)
2. Supporting function

**Example data that were analyzed by these scripts are available: https://doi.org/10.6078/D1B13V**
